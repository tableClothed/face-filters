--------------------
Facial filters, based on the ones available on f. e. Snapchat.

Using:
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Dlib
- pictures found on the internet

The filters:
- making your face look 'cuter' (*babyface.py*) 
- realtime face-swapping with a photo (*faceswap.py*)
- quick makeup (*...*)
- style transfer from a painting (*...*)
- snapchat dog ears (*doggy.py*)
- disproportion wave (*...*)
- exaggerated mounth and eyes(*exgr.py*)
- eyes colour change (*eyecolor.py*)

## Facial landmarks:
The dlib's facial landmarks indexes cheat sheet, I used to detect specific parts of a face:

where *file.py* is the name of the file (file names with a specific effect are listed above).
